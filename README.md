Explainable-Cyberbullying-detection(GenEx)

Cyber bullying detection at it’s core intends to classify a given text corpus as a bullying tag
or not. It is a classification tag where the output generated is positive or negative label. Going a
step inside, bullying detection can be divided into sub tasks which aim to provide a more clearer
and accurate information about the nature of the bully tag. Sub task 1 is to identify the rationale,
i.e the motto/intention behind the bully. Second one includes sentiment analysis which classifies
the given text as a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. The target text identification identifies
the exact part of the text which is being classified as a bully tag. Together all these sub tasks
perform the major job at hand i.e cyber bullying detection. Coming to the nature of algorithm
used for the task at hand, bullying detection is a binary classification task and the sub tasks are
also classification models, sentiment analysis being a multi class classification task and rationale
and target text identification being binary classification tasks.
